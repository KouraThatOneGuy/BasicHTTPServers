# BasicHTTPServers

This repository contains implementations of basic HTTP servers in various programming languages. The primary goal of this project is to serve as a learning exercise, providing semi-advanced projects to facilitate the correct learning of these languages. Please note that these servers may not function correctly; if they don't work, um, whoops :b.

## Implemented Languages

The repository includes HTTP server implementations in the following languages:

- C
- C++
- C#
- Java
- JavaScript (Node.js)
- Python

## Prerequisites

To run the servers, ensure you have the appropriate runtime environments or compilers installed for each language:

- **C**: GCC or any standard C compiler
- **C++**: G++ or any standard C++ compiler
- **C#**: .NET SDK
- **Java**: JDK
- **JavaScript**: Node.js
- **Python**: Python interpreter

## Usage

Instructions for running each server are as follows:

### C

1. Compile the server:

   ```bash
   gcc HTTPServer.C -o http_server
   ```


2. Run the server:

   ```bash
   ./http_server
   ```


### C++

1. Compile the server:

   ```bash
   g++ HTTPServer.cpp -o http_server
   ```


2. Run the server:

   ```bash
   ./http_server
   ```


### C#

1. Compile the server:

   ```bash
   csc HTTPServer.cs
   ```


2. Run the server:

   ```bash
   mono HTTPServer.exe
   ```


### Java

1. Compile the server:

   ```bash
   javac HTTPServer.java
   ```


2. Run the server:

   ```bash
   java HTTPServer
   ```


### JavaScript (Node.js)

1. Install dependencies (if any):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```


2. Run the server:

   ```bash
   node HTTPServer.js
   ```


### Python

1. Run the server:

   ```bash
   python HTTPServer.py
   ```
